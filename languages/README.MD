# Community Translations

Thank you for your interest in helping us make Scryarc accessible to users around the world! This folder contains all of the language "packs" that the bot uses for its commands, descriptions, and responses. Your contributions are essential for bringing Scryarc to new communities.

### **How It Works**

The bot's text is not hard-coded. Instead, it reads from the JSON (`.json`) files in this directory. Each file is named after an official [language locale code](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) (e.g., `en-US` for US English, `de-DE` for German). The bot loads these files on startup, which means your contributions can be added without needing to restart the bot.

### **How to Contribute**

There are two ways you can help: improving an existing translation or adding a new one.

#### **A. Correcting or Improving an Existing Translation**

If you notice a typo, a grammatical error, or a phrase that could be worded better in a language you speak:
1.  Navigate to the file for that language (e.g., `es-ES.json` for Spanish).
2.  Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon on GitHub to make your changes directly.
3.  When you're finished, submit your changes as a Pull Request, explaining what you improved.

#### **B. Adding a New Language**

This is the best way to have a major impact on the project!
1.  **Copy the Template:** Open the `en-US.json` file. This is our base template. Copy its entire content to your clipboard.
2.  **Create a New File:** Go back to the main `languages` folder. Click `Add file` > `Create new file`.
3.  **Name the File:** Name your new file according to the correct Discord locale code for the language you are adding (e.g., `pt-BR.json` for Brazilian Portuguese).
4.  **Translate the Content:** Paste the English content into your new file. Now, carefully translate all
