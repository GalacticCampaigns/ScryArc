## What is Scryarc?

Scryarc is a powerful Discord bot designed to automate the administrative work of running a tabletop roleplaying game server. It acts as a "Server Architect," allowing Game Masters and server admins to instantly build fully configured, permission-ready spaces for their campaigns. By handling the tedious setup of channels and roles, Scryarc lets you spend less time on configuration and more time telling your story.

Built to be system-agnostic, Scryarc is the perfect foundational tool for any TTRPG, from D&D and Pathfinder to Sci-Fi and horror campaigns.

## Core Features

* **Automated Game Setup:** Use a single command (`/new_game`) to generate a complete game space, including forum channels, private text channels, and game-specific roles.
* **Moderator Approval Queue:** A configurable system that allows moderators to approve or deny new game requests before channels are created, ensuring quality control.
* **Flexible Permissions:** Admins can define who can create games‚Äîall users, members with a specific role, or admins via the approval queue.
* **Deep Customization:** Configure channel naming conventions, GM permissions, and automated messages to fit your server's unique style.
* **Bot Integration:** Automatically assign permissions to other bots (like dice rollers or character sheet managers) in newly created game channels.
