## What is Scryarc?

Scryarc is a powerful Discord bot designed to automate the administrative work of running a tabletop roleplaying game server. It acts as a "Server Architect," allowing Game Masters and server admins to instantly build fully configured, permission-ready spaces for their campaigns. By handling the tedious setup of channels and roles, Scryarc lets you spend less time on configuration and more time telling your story.

Built to be system-agnostic, Scryarc is the perfect foundational tool for any TTRPG, from D&D and Pathfinder to Sci-Fi and horror campaigns.
